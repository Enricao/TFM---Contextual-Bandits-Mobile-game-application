# ContextualBandits: Mobile game application
Lin-UCB contextual bandit algorithm is applied to offline mobile game data to optimize revenue and user experience when testing different game variants.

This repository is a collection of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks and python files. Notebooks show results obtained and python files contain source code of the algorithm and auxiliar functions to run the notebooks.
